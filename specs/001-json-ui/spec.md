# Feature Specification: 웹 기반 슬라이드쇼 편집기

**Feature Branch**: `001-json-ui`  
**Created**: 2025년 9월 30일  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "웹 기반 슬라이드쇼 편집기를 만든다. 사용자는 이미지를 업로드하고, 타임라인에 배치하여 순서와 시간을 조절할 수 있다. 각 슬라이드의 크기, 위치, 회전 등을 편집할 수 있으며, 슬라이드 간 전환 효과도 설정 가능하다. 편집한 결과는 미리보기로 확인할 수 있고, JSON 형식으로 내보내 다른 시스템과 연동하거나 저장할 수 있다. 목표는 직관적이고 확장 가능한 UI 편집기를 제공하여 누구나 손쉽게 시각적인 슬라이드쇼를 제작할 수 있도록 하는 것이다."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to create a slideshow. They upload several images, arrange them on a timeline, and set how long each image should be displayed. They adjust the size and position of some images to focus on specific details. They add fade transitions between all slides. Finally, they preview the entire slideshow to see the result and then export the project as a JSON file to save their work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an image on their computer, **When** they drag and drop it onto the editor's image library, **Then** the image appears in the library, ready to be used.
2. **Given** an image is in the library, **When** the user drags it to the timeline, **Then** a new slide is created on the timeline with that image.
3. **Given** a slide is selected on the timeline, **When** the user changes the "rotation" value in the control panel to "90", **Then** the image in the main canvas rotates 90 degrees.
4. **Given** a slideshow with multiple slides is created, **When** the user clicks the "Preview" button, **Then** a modal window appears and plays the slideshow from beginning to end, showing all edits and transitions.
5. **Given** a user has finished editing their slideshow, **When** they click the "Export" button, **Then** a JSON file representing the entire project is downloaded to their computer.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to upload a non-image file?
- How does the system handle very large image files? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system resize, compress, or reject large images? What is the size limit?]
- What happens if the duration of a slide is set to zero or a negative number?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload image files (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF).
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a timeline interface where users can add, remove, and reorder slides by dragging and dropping.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust the display duration of each slide on the timeline.
- **FR-004**: For each slide, users MUST be able to edit the image's position (X, Y coordinates), size (scale), and rotation.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a selection of transition effects (e.g., Fade, Slide, Zoom) that can be applied between slides.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a real-time preview of the slideshow, reflecting all edits.
- **FR-007**: System MUST be able to export the entire slideshow project structure into a single JSON file.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow importing a project from a previously exported JSON file. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The description only mentions export, but import is a logical counterpart. Is this functionality required for the initial version?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents the entire slideshow. Contains global settings (e.g., canvas dimensions) and a collection of Slides.
- **Slide**: Represents a single element in the timeline. Contains a reference to an Image, its duration, timeline position, and properties (position, scale, rotation).
- **Image**: The visual asset used in a slide. Stored in a library within the project.
- **Transition**: Defines the animation effect between two consecutive slides. Has a type (e.g., 'fade') and duration.
